This webpage is a weather app that prompts users to enter a zip code, then displays current weather information for that location or a friendly error message if the zip code is not found.

For this project i will be using an external API to retrieve weather data.


By default, the app should display a title, input box for zip code, and submit button.

When the submit button is clicked, the application should fetch weather data from api.openweathermap.org.
